# SQL Portfolio
Welcome to my SQL portfolio!

In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects and SQL queries I've developed to analyze data, gain insights, and solve problems using Structured Query Language (SQL). These projects are designed to showcase my skills in handling relational databases and my ability to perform data analysis using SQL queries.

Contents
SQL Projects: Here you'll find a variety of projects spanning from data exploration to more detailed analyses, each focusing on different aspects and techniques of SQL.

SQL Queries: In addition to complete projects, I've also included individual SQL queries that demonstrate specific skills such as data aggregation, filtering, sorting, and data manipulation.

Navigating this Repository
If you're new to SQL or simply interested in exploring my projects, I recommend starting with the projects section. Each project has its own README file that provides a description of the project, the data used, and the objectives of the analysis.

If you're interested in seeing specific examples of SQL queries, you can explore the SQL queries section. Here you'll find a list of queries along with a brief description of what each query accomplishes and the expected results.

Contact
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions about any of the projects or SQL queries in this repository, feel free to reach out. I'm always interested in receiving feedback and collaborating on projects related to SQL and data analysis.

I hope you find this repository useful and enjoy exploring the projects and SQL queries!
